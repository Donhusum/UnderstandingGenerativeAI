Across the Atlantic in the United States, it's the chocolate chip cookie that reigns supreme. This iconic cookie, packed with gooey chocolate chips, is a staple in American households. Whether homemade or store-bought, chocolate chip cookies are loved for their chewy texture and sweet, chocolatey taste.

Down under in Australia, the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) biscuit is the most popular cookie. Originally baked by wives and sent to soldiers abroad due to their long shelf life, ANZAC biscuits are made with ingredients like oats, coconut, and golden syrup. These hearty cookies have a chewy, dense texture and a rich, caramel-like flavor. They hold a special place in Australian and New Zealand culture, particularly on ANZAC Day, when they are baked to honor the soldiers of both nations.
